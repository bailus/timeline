			<description>Telecom introduces its 0867 access package, in order to “separate Internet traffic from traditional voice calls in order to improve the network management of Internet traffic”. Telecom charges its customers 2c/min after ten hours of free monthly access for calls to local dial-up numbers. To avoid this charge, ISPs are forced to sign an "0867 agreement" with Telecom for 0867 numbers. 0867 numbers are exempt from the interconnect termination payments regime.</description>

Freenet gets the majority of its revenue from interconnect fees paid by Telecom. When users make a modem call from their Telecom phone line to Freenet on Compass' network, Telecom pays a fee to Compass. Several companies soon follow this model: i4free, surf4nix, Zfree and Splurge.</description>

But a call divert feature transfers them to Clear's network so Telecom is still faced with paying interconnect charges to Clear, who have a revenue-sharing agreement with i4free. Telecom severely restricts the number of calls routed into i4free, arguing that the high volume of calls would overwhelm its exchange on Airdale St in Auckland.</description>

UBS has a maximum upstream bandwidth of 128 kbit/s. Initially download speeds were limited to 256 kbit/s, with 1 Mbit/s and 2 Mbit/s options added later in the year. In late 2005 Telecom cancels its previous wholesale arrangements for JetStream and its plans with other ISPs. Only Telecom's own ISP, Xtra, could sell plans faster than the UBS options.</description>
